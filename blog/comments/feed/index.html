					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tangylife.com/blog/best-antiviral-nasal-spray-for-cold-sinus-virus/#comment-1533&quot;&gt;Tillie Morlan&lt;/a&gt;.

XLear Nasal spray, https://amzn.to/2NXz5HI,  is also a great brand to use for this, it has different options for kids, sinuses and normal cold / congestion. We haven&#039;t included that brand here since we wanted to cover those brands which are available in India as well as globally... and a year back Xlear wasn&#039;t listed on amazon india. 
Thank you for asking this question and posting a comment :D]]></description>
